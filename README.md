# Generation-of-Ballistic-Data
Generation of Ballistic data in MATLAB, based on given set of inputs and constants.

Parameters -
1. x, y, z: These parameters represent the position of the ballistic body in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The x-coordinate denotes the horizontal position, the y-coordinate represents the vertical position, and the z-coordinate signifies the depth or distance along the third axis.

2. vx, vy, vz: These parameters correspond to the velocity components of the ballistic body in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. They indicate the rate of change of position with respect to time in each coordinate axis.

3. ax, ay, az: These parameters denote the acceleration components of the ballistic body in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. They represent the rate of change of velocity with respect to time in each coordinate axis.

4. Elevation angle: The elevation angle is the angle between the horizontal plane and the line connecting the observer or launch point to the ballistic body. It describes how high the object is above or below the observer or launch point.

5. Azimuth angle: The azimuth angle is the horizontal angle measured clockwise from a reference direction (such as north) to the projection of the line connecting the observer or launch point to the ballistic body onto the horizontal plane. It indicates the direction or bearing of the object relative to the reference direction.

These parameters collectively provide essential information about the ballistic body's position, velocity, acceleration, and orientation in three-dimensional space. They are crucial for tracking, analyzing, and predicting the trajectory and behavior of the object during its flight. Additionally, these parameters serve as inputs for mathematical models, simulations, and calculations that involve ballistic motion, such as range estimation, impact prediction, and target tracking.
